|      Async Mongo Loader    |
+----------------------------+

A high-performance API built with Rust, leveraging Tokio's async runtime 
to efficiently upload multiple files concurrently into MongoDB. This API 
processes files in parallel, ensuring fast and scalable data ingestion. 
It supports concurrent file ingestion using Tokio, asynchronous MongoDB 
integration, fast JSON processing, and includes error handling and logging.

Usage
1 Enter your MongoDB connection string in a `.env` file:
    MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
2 Build the project:
    + cargo build
3 Run the API, specifying the database and collection:
    + cargo run <database_name> <collection_name>
